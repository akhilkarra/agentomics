# Welcome to Agentomics: Exploring Multi-Agent LLM Systems for Economic Simulations

This Jupyter Book serves as the central hub for the Agentomics project, an exploration of designing and implementing multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems for simulating complex economic interactions. The project aims to investigate the feasibility and potential of these advanced AI systems in modeling and analyzing various economic scenarios.

Within this book, you will find a wide range of content, including proposals for simulation scenarios, meeting notes, progress tracking, and research findings. The goal is to create a rich and informative resource that showcases the capabilities and limitations of multi-agent LLM systems in economic simulations.

As you navigate through this book, you will discover the various components of the Agentomics project, from the initial proposals and ideas to the latest developments and insights. Whether you are interested in the technical aspects of multi-agent LLM systems or the economic applications of these models, this book aims to provide a valuable resource for understanding and exploring the potential of these innovative technologies.
