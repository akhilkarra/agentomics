# Main Page for Proposal Scenarios

This page serves as a hub for my proposals on potential scenarios to simulate using multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems. I have developed these proposals to explore the capabilities and limitations of these advanced AI systems.

You can find links to individual scenario proposals in the table of contents.
